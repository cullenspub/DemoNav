# Demo Nav - Modern Android app navigation

Demo project to reinforce and share techniques, components, and libraries
for implementing navigation in a modern Android application


## Principles of Navigation
### Fixed start destination  
### Navigation state is represented as a stack of destinations  
### Up and Back are identical within your app's task  
### The Up button never exits your app  
### Deep linking simulates manual navigation  

## Tools of Navigation
### Navigation Component
#### Navigation graph
destinations and actions
#### NavHost
NavHostFragment
#### NavController

## Fundemental Assumptions
### Android Jetpack (androidx...) as the primary component library
![Jetpack Functionality](images/Jetpack.png)
[Single Activity App as preferred architecture](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/05/use-android-jetpack-to-accelerate-your.html?m=1)
