# Demo Nav - Modern Android app navigation

Demo project to reinforce and share techniques, components, and libraries
for implementing navigation in a modern Android application


## Principles of Navigation
1. Apps have a fixed start destination  
1. Navigation state is represented as a stack of destinations  
1. Up and Back are identical within your app's task  
1. The Up button never exits your app  
1. Deep linking simulates manual navigation  

## Tools of Navigation
1. Navigation Component
1. Navigation graph
   1. destinations and actions
1. NavHost
1. NavHostFragment
1. NavController

## Fundemental Assumptions
